# Hi, I'm Yashodhan Hakke ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who thrives on solving challenges with AI and drawing inspiration from the world of anime. Like my favorite anime heroes, Iâ€™m always pushing the limitsâ€”whether itâ€™s coding or chasing the thrill of motorcycling. When I'm not building deep learning models, youâ€™ll find me on a ride, feeling the wind and embracing the adventure. My top anime picks? *One Piece* and *Vinland Saga*â€”both inspire my drive to explore new horizons. Let's connect and embark on an exciting journey together!
